# Expense-Tracker

This Expense Tracker is something I built when learning and testing out HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to create something practical that would also challenge me to work with live data input, computation, and local storage. The project's purpose was to enable users to monitor their income and expenses, see their transaction history, and view a running balance—all within a clean and user-friendly interface.

I began with crafting a plain structure using HTML and styling the same using CSS in a neat, minimal form. I attempted to make it as user-friendly as possible as a form by letting users add a title and a value to a transaction as well as tell whether it's income or expenditure. I went ahead and, with JavaScript, applied the logic: of adding/deleting transactions, adjusting the balance dynamically, and dynamically showing it all in the browser.

One of the greatest things I put in place was the utilization of local storage. Saving the transactions locally meant users wouldn't lose their data when they closed the page and came back another time. It made the application feel so much more realistic and polished—like something that somebody might be able to use regularly to balance their finances.

I also gained a lot of knowledge regarding working with arrays and objects in JavaScript, iterating over data, formatting numbers, and updating the DOM in response to user actions. The logic to maintain the totals correctly and deal with edge cases (such as negative amounts or bad input) was a good learning experience.

This Expense Tracker might look straightforward at first glance, but it taught me so many great things about working with user data, browser state management, and building responsive UI components. More than a coding exercise, it felt like taking a step toward making apps that can help people solve real-world problems—and that's the kind of developer I want to be.
